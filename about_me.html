    <p>Hi there, I’m Morgan! Based out of North Carolina, I’ve worn a lot of hats in my lifetime. I’ve been a creator, a leader, a student, and many other things that have served to lend me a plethora of enriching life experiences, experiences I draw from for each new thing I set out to do. I bring passion and curiosity to each and every project alongside my experience, and my resiliency and creative problem-solving help me out when the going gets tough. Some professional and academic pride points of mine are being welcomed into a national honor society, having my writing published, and being recognized and elevated as a Team Leader by an employer. I’m always looking to expand that list!</p>

    <p>In my personal life, my interests are as varied as my experience. I genuinely enjoy learning, so time spent researching an interesting topic or expanding my knowledge in a field is time well spent in my eyes. I like creating art, specifically through the medium of writing, and I dream of publishing my own novels someday. “Nerd” might as well be my middle name, because I enjoy plenty of “nerdy” hobbies like reading and playing video games, too. I’m also well on my way to becoming a crazy cat lady- of course, I have three, so maybe I’m already there...</p>
